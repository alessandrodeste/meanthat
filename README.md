========

This is a prototype of mean stack project. *For now, just an experiment.*

I thank [Angular-App](https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app) project.

## What's working now?

[ ] mongodb init (not started)
[-] server (started)
[ ] client (not started)

## Goals

1. Find a compromise on folder/file organization
2. Try mongodb security and pattern
3. Configure Grunt to test his magics
4. Have a scaffolding project (no, I will not use yo for now)
5. Keep a repository to test new patterns or libraries
