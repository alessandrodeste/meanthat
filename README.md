========

This is a prototype of mean stack project. *For now, just an experiment.*

## What's working now?

- [ ] server (started)
- [ ] mongodb init (not started)
- [ ] client (not started)

## Goals

1. Find a compromise on folder/file organization
2. Try mongodb security and pattern
3. Configure Grunt to test his magics
4. Have a structured project to start others (no, I will not use yo for now)
5. Keep a repository to test new patterns or libraries

## What is not?

- it is not yo scaffolding

## TODO

- [ ] client
    - [ ] base angularjs application
    - [ ] index.html
    - [ ] web service test
    - [ ] first grunt setup
- [ ] server
    - [ ] security local
    - [ ] security oauth2 google service (passport)
    - [ ] service task
    - [ ] service user
    - [ ] service tag_hierarchy
- [ ] remove useless comment

## To Run

1. configurations
    1. server/config.js.ori to server/config.js
    2. client/???/config.js (TODO)
2. start mongodb
3. npm install (client & server)
4. grunt (client)
5. start server
